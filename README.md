# YouTube-Video-Audio-Downloader
</br>
:rocket: There are a lot of websites which offers downloading video from YouTube but none of them allows to 

**Download in Resolution of your own choice.**

</br>

*So I decided to write my own script for this purpose.*

</br>
I found that their are two python libraries to support the cause, I found  *pytube*  to be more easy and appealing.
</br>
But YouTube doesn't give you what you want staright away.
</br>
Next  *Problem*  I had was to merge the video and audio of your own choice and  *Challenge*  was to keep it simple to use for others sake.
</br>

### Requirements (If using Python file)
> pytube</br>
> > In Windows CMD: py -m pip install pytube</br>
> > In Linux terminal: sudo pip install pytube</br>

> pyfiglet</br>
> > In Windows CMD: py -m pip install pyfiglet</br>
> > In Linux terminal: sudo pip install pyfiglet</br>

> ffmpeg
> > Download it from their website.
> > Add it's bin to environment

:camel: ***That's it.*** :sparkles:
