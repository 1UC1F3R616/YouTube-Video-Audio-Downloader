</br>
</br>
*So I decided to write my own script for this purpose.*
</br>
I found that their are two python libraries to support the cause, I found *pytube* to be more easy and appealing.
</br>
But YouTube doesn't give you what you want staright away.
</br>
Next *Problem* I had was to merge the video and audio of your own choice and *Challenge* was to keep it simple to use for others sake.
</br>

### Requirements
> pytube</br>
> > In Windows CMD: py -m pip install pytube</br>
> > In Linux terminal: sudo pip install pytube</br>

> pyfiglet</br>
> > In Windows CMD: py -m pip install pyfiglet</br>
> > In Linux terminal: sudo pip install pyfiglet</br>

> ffmpeg
> > Download it from their website.
> > Add it's bin to environment

:camel: ***That's it.*** :sparkles:
